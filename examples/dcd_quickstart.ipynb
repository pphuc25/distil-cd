        "TL;DR: Distillation Contrastive Decoding work introduces an innovative decoding approach that enhances language model reasoning by leveraging the concept of contrastive decoding (Innovates upon the traditional contrastive decoding and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting methods). It operates by contrasting the logits from a expert model (Answer right) with Amateur model (Answer wrong). Notably, both models are the same.\n",
